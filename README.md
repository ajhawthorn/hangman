### How to play the Hangman Game

Can you guess the word?
Type a letter on the keyboard to guess a letter.
If the answer contains your letter, it will appear in the correct position(s) in the word and you can guess again.
For every wrong guess, an element of the hangman will appear.
Can you guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn?

To win the game, guess all the letters.
If the hangman appears before you've guessed the letters then it's game over!

You can click the Restart button to have another go.
